                        <p>During our first day, we were assigned to clean the system units that were stashed at the IT Department office. We used paintbrushes to remove every debris and dust that was found inside the PC unit. We disconnected the fans and wiped them with clean cloth.</p>

                        <p>We then reconnected the wires and re-installed the fans in order to check if the PC was still working. After checking every connection of the parts to the motherboard and made it boot, the IT officer in charge told us to remove every part then install everything again. We cable managed the wires and managed to make the system boot.</p>

                        <p>We were also taught on how to wire RJ45 Ethernet Cables. We used a crimping tool. We learned about the wiring patterns, which are straight-through and crossover. Me and my pair used the straight-through pattern, and then tried testing it using a ethernet cable tester.</p>

                        <p>I also designed an editable certificate template for their OJT completers. I used WPS Office in this output in order for it to be easily editable by the secretary with the details and names of the OJT completers.</p>
