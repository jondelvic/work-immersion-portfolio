            <p>We were assigned to the IT department of Sacred Heart Galimuyod, and our first task was to clean a system unit which we're going to use to reformat and reinstall its OS.</p>
            <p>We were also then told to try taking the parts of the PC out and try installing them back in. We were left alone so having experience building a PC unit from scratch before, I assisted my classmates in what the parts are and taught them the parts and where they will be connected/installed.</p>
            <p>After our lunch break, we were also assigned to troubleshoot a PC unit sent to the IT department. It wouldn't turn on at first but we eventually figured out that the PSU was the problem, so we replaced it with a different one then it booted up. </p>

            <p>Our first task of the day in the IT Department was to check the PC units stashed at the office. We first tried testing them to see if it will boot and if it doesn't, we will troubleshoot it with the guidance of the IT personnel.</p>
            <p>We managed to test 5 working system units and 2 defective ones, which respectively, have a faulty SSD and don't have a hard drive. I made one mistake by inserting the front panel connectors on the wrong spot as the motherboard didn't have guides and I don't have them memorized.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, we needed to recover files from a formatted flash drive, and with the use of simple and intuitive software, the files were recovered.</p>
            <p>When we came back after our lunch break, we were then assigned to assemble a LAN ethernet cable, which was hard for me as I was colorblind but my classmate assisted me with the colors. I wasted one RJ-45 connector because I was misinformed on how to lock it using the crimping plier but successfully made my second attempt work.</p>
            <p>After finishing our ethernet cables, we tested them using a tester and tried connecting our cable which was a straight-through pattern, and it worked when connected from the router to the PC unit. We also tested the other pair's cable which used the cross-over method, and was taught how to set up a local server from PC to PC in order to store or share files in the other PC and vice versa.</p>

            <p>During our morning shift, we didn't really have much tasks assigned. However, we had discussions with the IT personnels of the department. They gave us their advice with regard to our career paths and discussed the possible work opportunities we may get.</p>
            <p>Our lunch today was also shouldered by them. We waited until dismissal and our person in charge allowed us to go home early today.</p>

            <p>We didn't get any task assigned again today, but we organized the stash of units and tools around the office. Some internet problems appeared and we observed how they troubleshoot such problems.</p>
            <p>Through observing how they solve such problems that is present in their office, we learn more on ways how to troubleshoot, and what might be the cause of internet problems in offices or own servers.</p>

            <div class="date">April 24, 2023</div>
            <p>Due to being the editor-in-chief of my school's Filipino publication and other sick days, I only managed to attend my work immersion again for this last week. I was busy as a layout artist for the Division City Meet, and spent most of my time layouting our 20 pages broadsheet for contest submission.</p>
            <p>This time, we were assigned to the printing services department and I was introduced on what they there. I tried printing on t-shirts using a heat press and organized the finished products. They also provided us snacks.</p>
            <p>We then organized the rack used for the stock t-shirts and used the remaining time to rest and waited for our dismissal.</p>

            <p>As we arrived in the morning, there were boxes and organizers delivered, and we helped carry them to the stock room and organized them. After lunch break, the secretary then called me to his office to discuss my case and he was considerate enough of my other responsibilities and told me to count that as my work immersion experience.</p>
            <p>He then told me to design to projects for him, an oath design template, and an original certificate design for their OJT trainees. He commended my finished work and we also talked about what to expect in college, and also heard some advice from him about it. I learned a lot from him and he also treated my snacks for the projects I've finished.</p>

            <p>Today, we helped organize their giveaways for their upcoming event and packed almost hundred giveaway bags. We then double-checked the amount of items included and called it a day since they told us that it was the only task assigned for us. However, I tried looking and observing the machines they use, and got interested on how they worked.</p>

            <p>I was called to cut a big printed sticker which will be installed on a sintra board for a local business store. After I finished it, I helped apply stickers on different sintra boards for an awareness panel used in the beaches. When we finished everything, we then cleaned the workspace and rested until dismissal.</p>

            <p>We didn't really have work assigned for us today, and the secretary told me the other day that it will be our full rest day as we receive our certificates in the afternoon. We proceeded to the conference office after lunch, and heard the secretary's speech congratulating us. Our certificates were handed to us and we took pictures. We expressed our gratitude for the learnings and experiences we've gained from our work immersion proper.</p>
